      <section id="main_content">
        <p>My passion for programming started when I was in high school, for me programming became the connection with that part of the human condition of being curious, learn and invent new things, so for me programming is an art as it is writing, painting, photography and composing music, is a way of transmitting knowledge in a beautiful and elegant way.</p>

<p>Photography is my other great passion, is something that shows that everything can be hugely different from a different angle. If you see the ordinary from another point of view it can be seen in an extraordinary way, a thousand beautiful things are born and die in just a blink of an eye and all this makes the world more beautiful.</p>

<p>But all the programming, or the arts or knowledge are nothing if it is not shared so that others can enjoy them and grow them, that's why I like at github to share what I learned through several years so together we can make this a better world</p>
