If you see the ordinary from another point of view it can be seen in an extraordinary way, a thousand beautiful things are born and die in just a blink of an eye and all this makes the world more beautiful.\r\n\r\nBut all the programming, or the arts or knowledge are nothing if it is not shared so that others can enjoy them and grow them, that's why I like at Sustentables to share what I learned through several years so together we can make this a better world\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n![hesenrre](http://d13pix9kaak6wt.cloudfront.net/background/hesenrre_1334861071_29.jpg)"}
